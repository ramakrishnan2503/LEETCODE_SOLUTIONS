# LeetCode Solutions Repository

Welcome to my LeetCode solutions repository! This repository contains individual solutions for various LeetCode problems. Each problem's solution is organized in a separate folder for easy navigation and reference.

## Organization

The repository is organized as follows:

- Each problem is represented as a folder, named after the LeetCode problem identifier (e.g., "problem-123").
- Inside each problem's folder, you'll find:

  - **Solution File**: For example, "solution.py" for Python solutions. This file contains the code to solve the problem.
  - **README File**: A detailed README file (e.g., "README.md") explaining the problem description and explanations. It serves as documentation for the solution.
